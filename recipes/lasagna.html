    <h1>Vegetarian Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Vegetables:</strong> Chop your choice of vegetables (e.g., bell peppers, zucchini, spinach, mushrooms) and sauté them with olive oil, garlic, and onions until tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Tomato Sauce:</strong> In a saucepan, combine canned tomatoes, tomato paste, and your favorite seasonings (such as basil, oregano, salt, and pepper). Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Ricotta Mixture:</strong> In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese with an egg and some chopped fresh herbs (like parsley or basil). Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Lasagna Noodles:</strong> Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble Lasagna:</strong> In a baking dish, spread a layer of tomato sauce, followed by a layer of noodles. Add a layer of the ricotta mixture, then a layer of sautéed vegetables, and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers, finishing with a layer of sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut into pieces.</li>
